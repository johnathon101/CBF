<h1>Industry Leading Doors & Windows</h1>
<p>Triton installs and warranties the best windows in the business according to JD Power four years running. Our Simonton line of windows provides unparalleled efficieny and value. When considering replacing the windows there are many factors that need to be evaluated before chossing the correct product for your application. If you live in an extremely windy area casements may be your best option. If there are clearance issues with the outswing of a window a double hung may be a very important consideration when chossing a product. Our salesmen are experienced in the industry and can shed some light on applications we have found the best and ones we would not reccomend. There are hundreds of window manufacturers available but we choose to install the best because we service the warranty.</p>

<p>We also install entry doors, storm windows, glass patio doors and any product that helps keep weather out of your home. When choosing a storm window it is important to take note of the side of your house it is on. East and west facing storm windows would benefit from a Lo-E offering from Larson, where windows on the North and South may not make it worth the additional cost. When choosing an entry door the decisions are plentiful. Our manufacturer, Provia, offers a wide array of glass packages, styles and colors. Please schedule a time to speak with one of our saleman and we would be delighted to explain our window and door offerings.</p>
